Feature: Preview a Numerical question
  As a teacher
  In order to check my Numerical questions will work for students
  I need to preview them

  Background:

  Scenario: Preview a Numerical question and submit a correct response.
    When I am on the "Numerical-001" "core_question > preview" page logged in as teacher
    And I should see "What is pi to two d.p.?"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "How questions behave" to "Immediate feedback"
    And I press "Save preview options and start again"
    And I set the field with xpath "//span[@class='answer']//input[contains(@id, '1_answer')]" to "3.14"
    And I press "Check"
    Then I should see "Very good."
    And I should see "Mark 1#00 out of 1#00"
    And I press "Start again"
    And I set the field with xpath "//span[@class='answer']//input[contains(@id, '1_answer')]" to "3,14"
    And I press "Check"
    And I should see "Please enter your answer without using the thousand separator (,)."
    And I press "Start again"
    And I set the field with xpath "//span[@class='answer']//input[contains(@id, '1_answer')]" to "3#14"
    And I press "Check"
    And I should see "Very good."
    And I should see "Mark 1#00 out of 1#00"

  Scenario: Preview a Numerical question with optional units
    Given I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher
    # Add the numerical question with optional units
    And I add a "Numerical" question filling the form with:
      | Question name    | Numerical 1                                                                                       |

    When I am on the "Numerical 1" "core_question > preview" page logged in as teacher
    Then I should see "Numerical 1"
    And I should see "What's $500 in Php?"
    # Answer question correctly.
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Answer | 27950 |
    And I press "Submit and finish"
    # Confirm that corresponding feedback is displayed.
    And I should see "The correct answer is Php27950"

    And "//img[contains(@src, 'gd-logo.png')]" "xpath_element" should exist
    And I press "Start again"
    # Answer question incorrectly.
    And I set the following fields to these values:
